Freshman year of college, I went to Dublin, Ireland and studied at Trinity College.  It was a crazy experience and I leanrned a ton about myself.  The best part about it was being in Europe and having the ability to hop on a plane, train or boat for super cheap and go just about anywhere. I got to meet people from all over the world.  I was forced out of my comfort zone when I moved from a small mountain town to a big city.  Turns out, I never want to live in a city.  But it was very fun to explore!
