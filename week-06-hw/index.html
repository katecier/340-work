  Traveling has always been a passion of mine.  I love how it feels to buckle myself into an airplane seat and fly to an unknown place. I am lucky to have already been to so many different cities and countries at the rightful age of 19.

  There is an art to traveling.  I think tha in order for someone to have a successful experience, they must be ready for adventure.  Yes, planning is smart.  It is good to have a destination in mind and maybe a few stops picked out along the way (a hostel or two might be good).  But the best way to travel is, as has been said many times before, to get lost.

  <p>
    If you're in a new place, especially a city with no mountains or any natural georloical formations telling you which direction might be which, the best thing to do is walk around it for an entire day.  Sometimes, going on a run and failing to find your way home will lead you to discover parts of the city you've never seen before.
