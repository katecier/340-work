# Summary:
This week I read about and researched HTML and how a computer uses it as a language.  To understand it better, I typed up some elements and tags on Atom using the markdown preview to see what the computer was processing.  I then read the chapter in the book about headings and paragraphs. I followed the instructions on the class Github page to make my text edit document go live.

## Homework:
In order to complete this week's homework, I had to go about it with patience in a trial and error fashion. I was able to create the index.html document quite easily just by the instructions online.  Where I ran into trouble was:
1.  Organizing my new index.html file correctly in my depository so it would appear on my Github account.
   * I posted in the class repo to see if anyone could help my with this as I thought the issue had to do with sourcetree.
   * I ended up going to last week's instructions and figured out that I needed to push my new documents on Sourcetree into the master repository.
   * This made it so the URL for the index.html file appeared simpler, like what was emphasized in this week's reading.

2.  It seemed like my changes were not being commited to my Github account.
    * I did not have the repositroy marked correctly as the Master one.

I was able to put the poem on my text edit document by using the Pre-Formatted Text Element.

## Going forward:
I am becoming more comfortable with sourcetree and github.  What I think has helped me the most is taking the time to go back and read about Sourcetree in order to be clear on pushing and pulling documents and linking to specific directories.  I am looking forward to creating a website and am fascinated by the fact that I can type something on my desktop and hit the refresh button and my words will appear on the web. Creating simple elements like horizonal lines to make a page appear more organized has made me interested in all the other elements we will eventually learn about to make a web page aesthetically pleasing.
