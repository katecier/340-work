<h1> <center> Spring = Happiness </center> </h1>
<div class="intro">
<center> <p>Many people found themselves relieved after a long, bleak winter when the the Spring Equinox took place on March 20th.  Most people, though, were unaware that the day was designated as the International Day of Happiness in 2013.  </p>
</center>
</div>

<p> The UN made the holiday to remind us to appreciate all we have and to never take anything for granted.  Things like our family, friends, pets and the table we all gather at for dinner often go unappreciated.  As a population, we must set aside time to be grateful for what we have and give our best pals plenty of hugs. </p>
<div class="quote"> <p> "The pursuit of happiness is a fundamental human goal and the need for a more inclusive, equitable and balanced approach to economic growth that promotes sustainable development, poverty eradication, happiness and the well-being of all peoples."

</p>
</div>
<p>The goal is to increase the world's happiness. one of the key ways to do this is by planting fun activities in your life, many of which include playing in the sunshine.
<p>
According to a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/06/sunshine-happiness-behavior-mood_n_4014477.html">new study</a> from the United Arab Emirates, there is correlation between happiness and time spent outdoors in the sun.  People with an outdoor lifestyle get more vitamin D and show less signs of depression.
