<h1> <center> Spring = Happiness </center> </h1>
<div class="intro">
<center> <p>Many people found themselves relieved after a long, bleak winter when the the Spring Equinox took place on March 20th.  Most people, though, were unaware that the day was designated as the International Day of Happiness in 2013.  </p>
</center>
</div>

<p> The UN made the holiday to remind us to appreciate all we have and to never take anything for granted.  Things like our family, friends, pets and the table we all gather at for dinner often go unappreciated.  As a population, we must set aside time to be grateful for what we have and give our best pals plenty of hugs. </p>
<div class="quote"> <p> "The pursuit of happiness is a fundamental human goal and the need for a more inclusive, equitable and balanced approach to economic growth that promotes sustainable development, poverty eradication, happiness and the well-being of all peoples."

</p>
</div>
<p>The goal is to increase the world's happiness. one of the key ways to do this is by planting fun activities in your life, many of which include playing in the sunshine.
<p>
According to a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/06/sunshine-happiness-behavior-mood_n_4014477.html">new study</a> from the United Arab Emirates, there is correlation between happiness and time spent outdoors in the sun.  People with an outdoor lifestyle get more vitamin D and show less signs of depression.

    Smile!!
</div>

<p>There are many things you can do to stay happy.  Most importantly, by making others happy you can make yourself happy. Make it a goal to compliment someone each day. Play in the sun and remember to slow down and breathe.  Give back by helping others.  Say plase and thank you. Pet your dog. Pat your friend on the back. Climb a mountain. Read a book.





<div class="text-element"> <p>
  You may still be wondering what you can do to build world happiness besides smiling.  The UN is trying to raise the <b>Gross National Happy index </b> by achieving 17 sustaiable develoment goals. Each of these goals aim to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all.
