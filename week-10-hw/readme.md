# Summary
I began the week by reading through the lesson and watching the videos.  I looked at Facebook and Pinterest to see how the displays would change when I adjusted the windows. The pixels and viewport lesson was confiuing until it was applied to writing the actual code where you simply have to use the <b>width=device-width<b> element. All the numbers, such as a device minimum viewport of 320px and fingers at 48px, are hard to keep track of.  After watching the videos, I found that the quizzes posted were really helpful- the breakpoint one let me visualize when the actual breakpoint occurs on the web.
