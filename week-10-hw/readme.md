I began the week by reading through the lesson and watching the videos.  I looked at Facebook and Pinterest to see how the displays would change when I adjusted the windows. The pixels and viewport lesson was confiuing until it was applied to writing the actual code where you simply have to use the <b>width=device-width<b> element.
