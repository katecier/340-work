<h1> What we do with it? </h1>
<p> Responsive web design uses HTML and CSS elements to not leave out any info on a site. Such elements include:
  <ul><li>Viewport: sets the visible area of a web page</li>
    <li>Media Query: limit the style sheets' scope by using media features, such as width, height, and color </li>
    <li>Flex Box: creates boxes that rearrange themselves on a page as its dimensions change. </li>
</ul>

           <h1> The Process </h1>
         <p>It is vital that you plan your design to successfully use RWD. RWD is used to help your site present information in a way thats easy for users to read.  It should also be aethetically pleasing, which is where the plannning comes in.  It is important to base your style elements around your content, so always plan your content first.  For example, in creating this page, I thought of the categories I was going to explain and then seperated using RWD techniques.  Begin my drawing the basic design of the page and noting where you want important content to be.  Then, pick your style elements to complement your layout theme.  There are many different basic layouts that have been created to move with the size of the device. </p>  </div>
