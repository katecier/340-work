        <center> <h1>How it Began</h1> </center>
        <p>I grew up running around and camping in the forests of the Rocky Mountains. My backyard was literally mountains filled with great, green pine trees.  Now, the sight of a pine tree brings me instantaneous joy.</p>
        <p>My mom never let us cut down the trees.  There was some really accessable ones on the hill by our house that would look great in the living room for Christmas.  But no one was brave enough to argue against mom, we'd always lose; there were plenty of trees, already dead, at the nursery. Ours were meant to live forever.</p>
        <p>It seemed the whole community, even the fish, had appreciation for the trees.  After Christmas, my lacrosse team and I piled into cars and collected old trees.  We would bring them to the nature preserve where they'd drop them into the bottom of lakes and ponds for food and shelter for the fish. Sometimes, if there were extra, we'd feed them to my goats.  Pine trees have many purposes. </p>
        <p>I've yet to explore all types of pine trees, but this website will give you more informaiton on the different types of pines you might see in Montana and how to take care of them.</p>
